## 📖 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create an on-chain auction system using Algorand Smart Contracts with TypeScript. It showcases the ability to manage global state, handle bids securely, and ensure fair auction rules — all in a trustless, decentralized environment.

Whether you're an Algorand developer, blockchain enthusiast, or just getting started with dApps, this project serves as a great starting point.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Allows users to **submit bids** to an auction.
- Automatically **tracks the highest bid** using the smart contract's global state.
- **Rejects bids** that are lower than the current highest bid.
- Updates the global state when a new highest bid is placed.

All logic is handled securely and transparently on-chain using Algorand's smart contract capabilities.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Built with **TypeScript** and **@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript**
- 🔒 Maintains **secure global state** (`highestBid`)
- 📈 Accepts bids and ensures **only higher bids** can update the auction
- 🧩 Easily extensible for future improvements like:
  - Bidder tracking
  - Auction deadlines
  - NFT rewards for winners
